# Linux CPU Performance Monitor

I've developed a CPU performance & processes monitor (like htop) for Linux. It displays 10 most CPU consuming processes, their memory consumption, runtime, etc.
I've used ncurses for beautifying the terminal output.

I've used OOP & made classes for System, Process, Processor.

**Note:** Use makefile to build the project.
